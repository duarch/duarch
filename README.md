### Hi there 👋


Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on this new feature
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on go projects
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Vim
- 💬 Ask me about the bible 
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm lockdown you can't reach me now (but I receive calls, e-mail, tweets, ...)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him (His but I don't have many stuff)
               You can call me André, Andy, Duarch, or Hey guy come here!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a cuber solver
